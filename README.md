## Studying Data Analysis and Applying the Concepts
[Gapminder Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albertovidalrod/gapminder-dataset)

In this activity, I performed:
- The initial analysis of the dataset characteristics.
- An unconditional **mono-variate** analysis of each of the \( D \) predictors, plotting their histograms and box plots, using all \( n \) observations (excluding those containing NaN values).
- A **class-conditional mono-variate** analysis of each predictor. I plotted the histograms and generated tables displaying the **mean** (\(\mu\)), **standard deviation** (\(\sigma\)), and **skewness** (\(\gamma\)), formatted in Markdown.
